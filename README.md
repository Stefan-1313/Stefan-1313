I graduated in 2007 from the Delft University of Technology (Dutch University) with Distinction in both MSc Mechatronics engineering and MSc Control engineering.
I love to analyze and solve challenging problems. Practical ones, but also scientific ones. I use software as a tool to create high-tech machines and/or advanced measurement instruments.
